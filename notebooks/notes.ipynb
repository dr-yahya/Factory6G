    "\n",
    "Advanced wireless communication systems are rapidly evolving toward 6G (IMT-2030) with unprecedented capabilities for industrial IoT applications. **6G will enable 10 million devices per square kilometer in smart factories**, representing a 10x improvement over 5G's 1 million devices/km², while supporting ultra-low latency (\\<1ms) and ultra-high reliability (99.9999%) for mission-critical industrial operations. This comprehensive analysis examines the technical parameters and implementation strategies for 6G in smart factory environments, with specific focus on compatibility with the Sionna simulation framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "The research reveals that 6G will utilize a multi-band spectrum approach spanning from sub-6GHz to sub-THz frequencies, with each band optimized for specific industrial applications. The **6.425-7.125 GHz band emerges as the primary globally harmonized frequency for initial 6G deployments**, while sub-THz bands (100-300 GHz) offer revolutionary capabilities for ultra-high-speed factory floor communications.\n",

    "## 6G frequency bands for industrial IoT and smart factories\n",
    "\n",
    "**Low Band Sub-6GHz (Primary Coverage)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **6.425-7.125 GHz band** represents the most significant advancement for 6G industrial applications, providing 700 MHz of harmonized spectrum across ITU regions. This band offers optimal propagation characteristics for wide-area factory coverage with excellent building penetration and cost-effective deployment. Path loss characteristics follow the Close-In (CI) model: PL(dB) = 32.4 + 10n log₁₀(d) + Xσ, where path loss exponent n = 1.4-1.7 for LOS scenarios and n = 3.2-3.4 for NLOS conditions. Shadow fading ranges from 2.7-2.9 dB (LOS) to 8.6-10.1 dB (NLOS).\n",
    "\n",
    "Legacy 5G bands (3.3-3.8 GHz, 4.4-4.8 GHz) will continue supporting industrial applications, ensuring backward compatibility with existing 5G industrial systems. These frequencies excel at providing wide-area coverage across industrial campuses and support massive IoT deployments with reasonable infrastructure costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mid Band 6-24GHz (Centimeter Wave)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **7-24 GHz range** (also designated as FR3) provides the optimal balance between coverage and capacity for smart factory applications. Specific allocations include 7.125-8.4 GHz, 12.75-13.25 GHz, and 14.8-15.35 GHz bands under study for WRC-27. These frequencies utilize the Alpha-Beta-Gamma (ABG) path loss model: PL(dB) = 10α log₁₀(d) + β + 10γ log₁₀(fc) + Xσ, with distance dependence α = 1.7 (LOS) and 3.2 (NLOS), and frequency dependence γ = 1.9 (LOS) and 3.4 (NLOS).\n",
    "\n",
    "This band supports high-capacity factory automation, precision manufacturing control, and real-time industrial sensing with superior penetration characteristics compared to mmWave frequencies. The extended mid-band offers up to 20 GHz of available spectrum for ultra-high capacity applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**High Band mmWave and Sub-THz (24GHz+)**\n",
    "\n",
    "mmWave frequencies (24-100 GHz) enable ultra-high data rates exceeding 10 Gbps for applications like high-definition machine vision and real-time robotic control. The **3GPP TR 38.901 Indoor Factory models** specify path loss as PL = 32.4 + 17.3 log₁₀(d) + 20 log₁₀(fc) + Xσ for LOS conditions. However, these frequencies suffer from limited range (\\<1 km) and poor obstacle penetration.\n",

    "The **3GPP TR 38.901 Indoor Factory (InF) model** serves as the foundation for industrial channel modeling, supporting frequencies from 0.5 to 100 GHz with bandwidth up to 1 GHz. This geometry-based stochastic model implements clustered multipath propagation with both LOS and NLOS scenarios, accommodating distances from 1-150 meters typical in factory environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "For sub-6GHz applications, the Close-In (CI) model provides: PL(dB) = 32.4 + 10n log₁₀(d) + Xσ, with path loss exponents n = 1.4-1.7 (LOS) and n = 3.2-3.4 (NLOS). Shadow fading standard deviation ranges from 2.7-2.9 dB (LOS) to 8.6-10.1 dB (NLOS).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Factory-Specific Propagation Characteristics**\n",
    "\n",
    "Industrial environments present unique propagation challenges due to metallic equipment, machinery, and structural elements. **Metal surfaces create enhanced reflections with reflection coefficients approaching -1**, while large equipment causes significant shadowing (10-30 dB additional loss). Corridors and aisles between equipment create waveguide effects that can enhance or degrade signal propagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key propagation parameters include:\n",
    "- **RMS Delay Spread**: 50-200 ns (sub-6GHz), 10-50 ns (mmWave), 5-20 ns (THz)\n",
    "- **Angular Spread**: 10-45° (azimuth), 5-20° (elevation)\n",
    "- **K-Factor**: 10-20 dB (LOS), 0-5 dB (NLOS)\n",

    "\n",
    "**THz and mmWave Characteristics**\n",
    "\n",
    "At THz frequencies, propagation exhibits significant sparsity with fewer dominant multipath components. **Diffuse scattering becomes dominant due to surface roughness effects**, while atmospheric absorption and molecular resonances create frequency-dependent losses. Path loss exponents range from ~2.0 (LOS) to 4.6 (NLOS), with delay spreads compressed to 4.27 ns due to the sparse nature of THz propagation.\n",

Higher subcarrier spacing enables shorter symbol durations, critical for ultra-low latency industrial IoT applications. Industrial applications will benefit from adaptive selection between narrow spacing (15-60 kHz) for coverage and wide spacing (480-960 kHz) for ultra-low latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**FFT sizes scale from 5G's maximum 4096 points to 8192 and potentially 16384 points**, supporting wider bandwidths and higher-order spatial multiplexing. The relationship FFT size = sampling frequency / subcarrier spacing enables flexible bandwidth allocation for diverse industrial applications.\n",
